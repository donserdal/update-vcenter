# update-vcenter

With this script I wanted to automate the upgrade of the vCenter Appliance. The script has very limited error checking and I am still looking to validate the upgrade before the upgrade is started.
I have scheduled the script to run at night and I have updated two minor versions of vSphere 7. I dont know If it works for 6.7!
